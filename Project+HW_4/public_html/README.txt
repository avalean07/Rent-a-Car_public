This is the folder for Assignment 4

In this readme.txt, the TA grading the assignment can find all the necessary information.
We created a folder called Project+HW_4 because it is not mentioned if the public_html folder has to be placed in a separate homework 4 folder or just in the repository. The TA grading this can find the contect of everything into the public_html folder, as it was told to us by Nguyen Thann, and this message will also be delivered via Teams to all of the known TAs for this course. Please redirect this message or readme.txt file to the TA that is responsible for grading this assignment. Thank you!
