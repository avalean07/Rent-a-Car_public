CD description:

For our CD we wanted to embrace a simple black and white design that matches our Rent-a-Car company logo. We followed the instructions given to us in the Assignment 4 PDF and went out and created the simple pages, the Home page and the Imprint page. On the home page, the user can find details about our company and the type of cars we have available, and on the imprint page, the user can find the disclaimer mentioned in the Assignment 4 PDF and a contact address, that is imaginary and that does not exist. Furthermore, on the lower side of the page, the user can see that our company is "registered" and that it has all the rights reserved, resembling a real company's website. We wanted to make this website as straight as possible and encapsulate as many things as possible in the CSS file, as it was requested per the Assignment sheet 4 PDF.
