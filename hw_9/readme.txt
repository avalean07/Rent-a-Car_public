For Assignment 9, we created a demo folder in the project folder, where Andrei did the experimental search page like the one presented on the 
website provided by the professor. After that, each one of us cloned that example demo page (autocomplete_full.html) page and adapted to the search forms
each one of us created for our previous homework. We created the demo page in the demo folder first, as mentioned in the homework, made sure it works
on its own, and as a separate page, with a separate file in which the tags are stored. 

After all that, each and one of us made a get_tags.php file for his search form folder that connects to the server and to the tadabase, and fetches the
names of the customers/mechanics/employees that match what the user inputs from the standard input into the search form.
