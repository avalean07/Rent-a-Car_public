Ok, so, Assignment 10. It seems like ipinfo.io gave us a 7 day trial, and we don't know if our map location thingy will still work afterwards. I guess we will wait
and see. It should not be an issue as we have 50k free calss, as the ipinfo.io states.

We implemented the User Map page, on which the user can see his loaction on the map, from the maintenance page, thus the user must log in successfully in order to be 
able to access it. After opening that page, the user will be able to see its exact location. Works very well!
