For Assignment 8, we created two new files. analyze_logs.php, which analyzes the logs of the Apache server file and parses through each log, 
and log_analysis.php, which is the file that uses php and javascript to finish the log analysis and generates chart canvases for our website.
We do not know if this the correct implementation of it, and we do not have the file log location in the apache server yet, but we are pretty
confident about our work.
